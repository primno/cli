/**
 * The {@link AppModule} class is defined as a module by the {@link MnModule} decorator.
 * A module is a container of components / sub-modules.
 * 
 * {@link AppModule} is the primary module and imports the {@link RecordModule} and {@link ListModule}.
 * The `bootstrap` components defined in these sub-modules will be started when this web resource is loaded.
 * 
 * {@link RecordModule} is the primary module for the page type `record` while {@link ListModule} is for the page type `list`.
 * A list page is a page that displays a list of records, like a main grid or a sub-grid,
 * while a record page is a page that displays a single record, like a form or a quick create form.
 * Each page type have their own component tree, this means that a list component cannot contain a record component and vice-versa.
